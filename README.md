# RL-for-MM-phishing-attacks
Is it possible that deep reinforcement learning algorithms improves 
the characterization of interactions during a phishing attack?
This paper, therefore, investigate the latter question and proposes approaches using deep reinforcement
learning for the characterization of interactions during mobile payment phishing attacks.
